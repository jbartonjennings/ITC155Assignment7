Pseudo code for sorting algorithm:

Largest = largest array index 

For (all other index values) {
	If (nums[index] > nums[largest])
  {
	Largest = index
  }
}

This modified version will not be faster than the standard version; it will take the same amount of timeâ€¦

This modified version will also make roughly N passes over N elements (same as the standard version).  So, its complexity is O(N^2)
